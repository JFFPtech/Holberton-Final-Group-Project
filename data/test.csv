paragraph,"Virginia Ann Marie Patton Moss (June 25, 1925 – August 18, 2022) was an American actress. After appearing in several films in the early 1940s, she was cast in her most well-known role as Ruth Dakin Bailey in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946). In 1949, Patton retired from acting, and her final film credit was The Lucky Stiff (1949)."
paragraph,"Patton was born in Cleveland, Ohio on June 25, 1925, to Marie (née Cain) and Donald Patton.[1][2] She was raised in her father's hometown of Portland, Oregon,[3] where her family moved when she was an infant.[4][5][6] She was a niece of General George S. Patton.[7] Patton graduated from Jefferson High School in Portland, and then moved to Los Angeles, California, where she attended the University of Southern California.[8]"

DeMille while in college.[8] She had several minor supporting film appearances before being cast in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) as Ruth Dakin Bailey, the wife of George Bailey's younger brother Harry.[9]"
